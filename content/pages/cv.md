I'm from Lancashire, in the north-west of England. I moved to Durham University to take a Bachelors and Masters in Theoretical Physics; my Masters' thesis investigated the hydrodynamics of polymeric fluids in shear flow, specifically the onset of shear banding. This mostly involved numerical simulations in C and Python.

I then moved up to Edinburgh University, to study for a PhD in soft condensed matter physics. I spent most of my PhD studying various aspects of the collective behaviour of self-propelled particles, with a focus on flagellated bacteria.

After finishing my PhD, I stayed in Edinburgh for just under a year, working as a Python web developer at Ecometrica, a company providing software-as-a-service to analyse geospatial data.

I then left Edinburgh, and moved to Amsterdam to work as a data scientist for the hotel platform Booking.com. I'm currently working there as a senior data scientist.

I spend most of my spare time programming. I've spent much of the past year reimplementing the typesetting language $\TeX$, first [in Python](https://github.com/eddiejessup/nex). After concluding the project couldn't be maintained without a strong type system to keep me honest, I restarted the project [in Haskell](https://github.com/eddiejessup/hex).

Outwith computers, I like a bit of philosophy, language, pretentious movies and stand-up comedy.

[Here's](/pdfs/cv.pdf) my CV.
